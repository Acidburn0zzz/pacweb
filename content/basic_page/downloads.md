## Release Info

We provide two diffrent images a ISO for buning to a CD/DVD, and a IMG file for
flashing to a USB stick using a utility like `dd`.  Both images are intended for
new installations only; an existing PacBSD system can always be updated with
`pacman -Syu`.

*   **Current Relase:** 2016-07-21

## Existing PacBSD Users

If you are an existing PacBSD user, there is no need to download a new image to
update your existing system. You may be looking for an [updated mirrorlist](#)
instead.

## BitTorrent Download (recommended)

If you can spare the bytes, please leave the client open after your download is
finished, so you can seed it back to others. A web-seed capable client is
recommended for fastest download speeds.
