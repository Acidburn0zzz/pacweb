Well, I've finally took the steps for getting the website up and running, though
while somethings aren't currently setup and working; I am working to the best of
my capabilities to get everything working smoothly.

It has took some time, but with a test ISO ready, and the website functional
( Kinda :p  ), things should be ready for testers soon.
