Over the next few days we will be migrating to a new name for the project. Due
to potential trademark issues with using [ArchBSD](https://archbsd.net/) and
our current logo. We have decided to rename the project.

The new name can currently be used to browser the website, but our current
certificates only work with ArchBSD.net, so there will be warnings when
browsing with https. We will have to wait a few days before our News
certificate will be generated to work with \*.pacbsd.org.

The Organization on git has been updated and can be found:
[PacBSD](http://github.com/PacBSD)

After the migration to our new name [PacBSD](http://PacBSD.org/) we will be
switching to a new website and new logo.
