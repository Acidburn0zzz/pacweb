OpenRC 0.26.2 is now in [testing], as this is a large update from what we had
some extra testing is needed before it will make its way into [core]. After
upgrading the init system will need to be reloaded. Once the updated OpenRC is
active verify that all services that should be running are with `# rc-status`
and re-enable any services that may be missing.

If any issues are found please report them to our [issue tracker on GitHub](https://github.com/PacBSD/abs/issues).
