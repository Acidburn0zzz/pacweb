I have been notified of a few issues that currently aren't working on the
website which I am fully aware of. I wasn't expecting any publicity until I had
finished, how ever, this can't be avoided by now. Yes, the website is incomplete
and not setup cleanly yet, the code hasn't fully been changed to reflect the
changes yet. I only setup the website yesterday, so please be patient, and I
will get there in due time. I am still busy setting up the website, and as soon
as I am done, I will provide the iso.

However there is a limited package set as of writing, and I'd really like to get
the website setup and fully functional before proceeding any further.

So don't bother asking for the ISO yet.

In the meantime, you can join the IRC channel: **irc.freenode.net #archbsd**
