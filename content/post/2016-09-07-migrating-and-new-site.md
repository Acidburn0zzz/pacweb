Over the past few weeks we have been migrating everything over to a new server,
due to some internal changes in maintainership as well as some issues with the
old server.  The progress of this migration is slowly coming along, for the most
part our repos are back up and working in regards to fetching packages with
pacman.  The Wiki, Forums, and Bug tracker still need to be resetup on the new
server.

At the same time we are moving the site over to a simplified website which
should make maintaining the site easier.  During this process most of the links
may not work for a while.

I would also like to thank our new hosting sponsor
[DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) for helping make this new server
possible.
