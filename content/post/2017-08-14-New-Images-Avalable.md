New installation images (20170814) are available for download from our [packages
server](https://packages.pacbsd.org/iso/) with images for both CD/DVD and USB
use. These images are based on FreeBSD 11.1-RELEASE, with it will bring Mesa
version 17 which allows us to offer support for the Wayland display server as
well as updated Xorg packages.

With this release the decision has been made to drop Chromium as a officially
supported package due to performance and compatibility issues with Chromium on
BSD. If Firefox or any of the other supported browsers don't fulfill your needs
then as a work around until BSD support improves upstream, Chrome/Chromium can
be ran under Wine or the Linux compatibility layer.
